#summary Installation guide

== Requirements =

PALM-siever needs `DipImage` to run. You can download it from [http://www.diplib.org]. Follow the instructions to install it on your platform.

== Installation =

  # Make sure `DipImage` is installed and remember the installation directory, which we will refer to as _DIP_DIR_
  # Copy “palm-siever-vX.X.zip” to a folder of your choice _PALM_DIR_ or download the latest version with
{{{
svn checkout http://palm-siever.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ palm-siever-read-only
}}}
  # Open MATLAB
  # Execute: (substitute _PALM_DIR_ with the dir where you extracted palm-siever)
{{{
addpath PALM_DIR
}}}
  # Modify the `palmsiever_setup.m` file to reflect your _DIP_DIR_.
  # Execute: `palmsiever_setup`

== Quickstart =
You need to run `palmsiever_setup` for each new MATLAB session (make sure to have _PALM_DIR_ in your path, or add it with `addpath`. Alternatively, you can add these two lines to your `startup.m` file.
{{{
addpath _PALM_DIR_
palmsiever_setup
}}}

To open a PRM file, use the “importprm” command. The syntax is simply:
{{{
importprm filename
}}}
The filename should be the full path to your PRM file. Note: it works best on local files.

You can open a CSV with: 
{{{
importprm('filename',',')
}}}

The command will load the data, with each column of the file as a separate variable.

To run the software, execute:
{{{
PALMsiever
}}}

It will ask to specify what variables are X position, Y position, localization precision for X and localization precision for Y.

You can specify them when opening the application.
{{{
PALMsiever(‘xVar’,’yVar’,’sigmaX’,’sigmaY’)
}}}
