#summary Grouping nearby consecutive localizations

= Grouping =

Grouping is the operation by which localizations appearing in consecutive frames are 'grouped' into a single localization.

PALMsiever allows two steps in the process. The first step identifies potential localizations belonging to the same molecule and assigns an ID to each group. The second keeps a single representative localization for each group, by averaging the position of all the members. 

This two-step approach allows the user to check the validity of the grouping before performing the final destructive operation of keeping a single representative for each group.

The main parameter is the maximum allowed distance between a molecule and its neighbour in a consecutive frame, *D*. This is usually kept in the order of the expected localization precision. The algorithm allows a molecule to blink, i.e. temporarily turn off and then on again, within a certain number of frames *dF*. Please refer to [1-2] for additional considerations for grouping.

*The Grouping GUI, callable under Point/Group.*

Once the grouping has ended, a message shows how many groups or molecules have been identified.
