#summary DBSCAN clustering plugin

= Introduction =

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN DBSCAN] (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) performs multi-dimensional clustering based on the local density of points. This plugin is implemented for 2-3 dimensions.

DBSCAN takes 2 parameters: _Eps_ and  _!MinPts_ (see Fig. 1). DBSCAN searches in a radius _Eps_ around each point. If that point contains at least _!MinPts_ then it counts as a _core point_. Any points at the edge of a cluster which are within _Eps_ of a _core point_, but are not themselves surrounded by _!MinPts_ are a _border point_ and count as part of the cluster. Any points which are not within _Eps_ of a core point are a _noise point_.
