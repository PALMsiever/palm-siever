#summary Importing a dataset into PALMsiever

PALMsiever supports a variety of different file formats out-of-the-box. They are all imported using the "File/Import" menu. If your format is not present, you can easily extend it (see [ExtendingPALMsiever]).

|| _Software_ || _Extension_ || _Notes_ ||
|| Generic text file || * || can be used on most tabular data ||
|| Leica_GSD || ascii || reads the 2D version, can be extended, please contact me if you need it ||
|| Octane || txt || -- ||
|| !PeakSelector || prm || reads in all data. Note it's better to export it in nanometers, as the text looses precision if you export it in pixel units. ||
|| QuickPALM || txt || -- ||
|| RapidSTORM || txt || everything except the metadata ||
|| UTrack_Julia || -- || -- ||
|| Vutara || csv || reads all 3D data Â ||
