#summary Cross-correlation based drift correction.

= Introduction =

This plugin uses image cross-correlation to correct sample drift, which does not require the presence of fiducial markers in the sample. Briefly, multiple super-resolved images are constructed for short time intervals (less than the total acquisition time), and each subsequent image is cross-correlated with the first image. The shift of the cross-correlation peak corresponds to the sample drift.

This method is described in detail in several publications, eg. Wang et al, Opt. Express 2014. In the nomenclature of Wang et al. this implementation essentially corresponds to "direct cross-correlation". (Side note: the redundant cross-correlation method presented in that paper looks very cool - but is not yet implemented in PALMsiever!).

NB: Cross-correlation based drift correction is generally less reliable than the fiducial approach, and works best for structures that contain lots of narrow lines (such as microtubules). In particular, I have found that for samples containing mainly sparse point-like structures (such as E. col RNA polymerase) the method often performs poorly.

Let's drift correct some microtubules!

To perform drift correction, you need to set the following parameters:
  * Min Pts/ Area
  * Min Frames
  * Cross corr pixel size
  * XCor fit window sz:
  * * test
