#summary Installation guide

= Requirements =

PALM-siever needs `DipImage` to run. You can download it from [www.diplib.org]. Follow the instructions to install it on your platform.

= Installation =

  # Make sure DipImage is installed and remember the installation directory, which we will refer to as _DIP_DIR_
  # Copy “palm-siever-vX.X.zip” to a folder of your choice PALM_DIR
  # Open MATLAB
  # Execute: “addpath PALM_DIR” (substitute PALM_DIR with the dir where you extracted palm-siever)
  # Modify the setup.m file to reflect your DIP_DIR.
  # Execute: “setup”

= Quickstart =
To open a PRM file, use the “importprm” command. The syntax is simply:
{{{
importprm filename
}}}
The filename should be the full path to your PRM file. Note: it works best on local files.

The command will load the data, with each column of the file as a separate variable.

To run the software, execute:
{{{
PALMsiever
}}}

It will ask to specify what variables are X position, Y position, localization precision for X and localization precision for Y.

You can specify them when opening the application.
{{{
PALMsiever(‘xVar’,’yVar’,’sigmaX’,’sigmaY’)
}}}
