#summary DBSCAN clustering plugin

= Introduction =

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN DBSCAN] (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) performs multi-dimensional clustering based on the local density of points. This plugin is implemented for 2-3 dimensions.

DBSCAN takes 2 parameters: _Eps_ and  _!MinPts_ (see Fig. 1). DBSCAN searches in a radius _Eps_ around each point. If that point contains at least _!MinPts_ then it counts as a _core point_. Any points at the edge of a cluster which are within _Eps_ of a _core point_, but are not themselves surrounded by _!MinPts_ are a _border point_ and count as part of the cluster. Any points which are not within _Eps_ of a core point are a _noise point_.

The really nice thing about DBSCAN is that "density" is a very biologically appropriate definition of a cluster. The minimum cluster density approximately relates to _!MinPts_ and _Eps_ as

Also, "noise" is ubiquitous in our measurements so it is nice to have this as an inherent property of the algorithm.

We will the example data "FtsZ-Dendra2 C crescentus live 3D 10 ms frame.mat". Here the goal is segment the (patchy) mid-cell rings and polar spots from the low density cytosolic/ membrane bound localizations.

Opening the plugin gives the following dialogue:

The two parameters _!MinPts_ and _Eps_ need to be set.
  * _!MinPts_ : It is best to treat this essentially as a smoothing parameter. Larger _!MinPts_ means less sensitivity to noisy fluctuations in background density. Smaller _!MinPts!_ allows sensitivity to very small clusters (assuming the background noise is small). *_!MinPts_=10* usually works well unless the clusters are very small or the data is very noisy.
  * _Eps_ : Manually vary this parameter to control the minimum density of the cluster (larger Eps = lower minimum density). The appropriate Eps depends on your sample and on the distance units of the dataset. In this dataset, _Eps_=20 works well.

DBSCAN adds two colums to the dataset: 
  * _dbscan_id_ :
  * _dbscan_type_ :
