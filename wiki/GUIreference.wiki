|| *Location* || *Command* || *Description* ||
|| File menu || Open || Opens a saved dataset (.MAT format) ||
|| File menu || Save || Saves the data and the state of PALMsiever to a .MAT file ||
|| File menu || Import || Imports data from a text file, see [Importing] ||
|| File menu || Export || Exports data to a text file, see [Importing] ||

|| File menu || Open CSV... || Legacy import function ||
|| File menu || Save CSV    || Legacy export function ||
|| File menu || Save TIFF.. || Saves the current rendered image into a 16-bit grayscale TIFF file. 0 corresponds to the 'Min' value, 2^16 corresponds to the 'Max' value. ||
|| File menu || Export PALM movie/ stack.. || Exports a movie of slices along the selected "time" axis. To export Z-stacks just select "Z" as the time axis. ||
|| Edit menu || Copy || Copies the current rendered image into the system's clipboard, as an RGB image. ||
|| Points menu || Sieve! || Discards all points which do not fall within the limits specified in the table, including the X, Y and Z variables. ||
|| Points menu || Sieve! (no XYZ) || Discards all points which do not fall within the limits specified in the table, but without taking into account the current limits for X, Y and Z. ||
|| Points menu || Group || Performs Grouping on the point localization data. See [Grouping] for more details ||
|| Points menu || Keep grouped only || Keeps a single localization per group (ID column), where each corresponding variable is averaged across the members of a same group. ||

|| Trace menu || Histogram || Collects all the points along the trace and plots the histogram of their distance from the centerline. ||
|| Trace menu || Density+DG fit || Collects all the points along the trace, plots the histogram of their distance from the centerline and fits it to a double Gaussian function. ||
|| Trace menu || Sigma profile || Collects all the points along the trace, fits a Gaussian function to the density of the distances of each block of points forming the trace, then plots the variation of the fitted sigmas. ||
|| Options menu || Color bar || When selected, plots a colorbar together with the rendered image. ||
|| Options menu || Scale bar || When selected, plots the scalebar of each rendered image. ||
