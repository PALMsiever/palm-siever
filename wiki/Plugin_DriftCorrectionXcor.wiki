#summary Cross-correlation based drift correction.

= Introduction =

This plugin uses image cross-correlation to correct sample drift, which does not require the presence of fiducial markers in the sample. Briefly, multiple super-resolved images are constructed for short time intervals (less than the total acquisition time), and each subsequent image is cross-correlated with the first image. The shift of the cross-correlation peak corresponds to the sample drift.

This method is described in detail in several publications, eg. Wang et al, Opt. Express 2014. In the nomenclature of Wang et al. this implementation essentially corresponds to "direct cross-correlation". (Side note: the redundant cross-correlation method presented in that paper looks very cool - but is not yet implemented in PALMsiever!).

One very minor innovation of the implementation presented here is that the time interval is not fixed - for each sub-image, it is constantly expanded until the minimum density of localizations per image is met. This is useful for the final frames of a dataset, where the number of localization per frame will usually drop.

NB: Cross-correlation based drift correction is generally less reliable than the fiducial approach, and works best for structures that contain lots of narrow lines (such as microtubules). In particular, I have found that for samples containing mainly sparse point-like structures (such as E. col RNA polymerase) the method often performs poorly.

To perform drift correction, you need to set the following parameters:
  * *Min Pts/ Area*: This is the minimum density of localizations required to form a sub-image. If there are not enough localizations, the cross-correlation amplitude will be very low, and it will not be possible to localize the peak. If this happens the drift graph will usually (but not always!) show lots of random spikes in measured drift. Generally *50 - 100 locs/ um^2^ * works reasonable well. The units here are locs/ (unit area)^2^ so depending on your data format you may need to convert this value to the appropriate distance units. Here, RapidStorm uses distance units of nm, so the right value is 50E-6 locs/ nm^2.
