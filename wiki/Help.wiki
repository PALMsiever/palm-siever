*PALMsiever* has been to facilitate interactive exploration and analysis of single-molecule localization microscopy data. 

You can start by reading the InstallationGuide, then the QuickTour will quickly get you started. For specific help, you can have a look at the [FAQ] or the other sections on the sidebar. If you get lost, have a look at WhoToAsk.

We hope you enjoy using PALMsiever as much as we did developing it.
