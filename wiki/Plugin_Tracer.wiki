#summary Documentation for Tracer v1.0

= Introduction =

Tracer allows the user to create a trace along a structure in an image. It uses the underlying molecule positions, not the rendered image.

*The Tracer GUI*

= Walktrough =

The protocol for tracing a filamentous structure is as follows:

  # Choose a Radius and a Step size. Radius should roughly be twice the radius of the structure. Step should be roughly twice the Radius parameter. You might need to adjust for your case
  # Press 'Trace!'.
  # Select a first point where to start the trace.
  # Select a second point, roughly along the direction of the structure you want to trace. 
  # Done! The software will trace your structure, show the trace on the current rendering as a green line, and save it to the workspace as variable 'Trace'.

= Additional Features =

 * Generate *cumulative histograms* along the trace
 * *Load* and *save* traces
 * Fit the histogram to a *single* or *double Gaussian* function
