#summary Documentation for Tracer v1.0

= Introduction =

Tracer allows the user to create a trace along a structure in an image. It uses the underlying molecule positions, not the rendered image.

*The Tracer GUI.*

= Walktrough =

The protocol for tracing a filamentous structure is as follows:

  # Choose a *Radius* and a *Step* size. Radius should roughly be twice the radius of the structure. Step should be roughly twice the Radius parameter. You might need to adjust them to your data.
  # Press '*Trace!*'.
  # Select a *first point* where to start the trace.
  # Select a *second point*, roughly along the direction of the structure you want to trace. 
  # *Done*! The software will trace your structure, show the trace on the current rendering as a green line, and save it to the workspace as variable 'Trace'.

*Tracing the default example data using the default parameters.*

= Additional Features =

 * Generate *cumulative histograms* along the trace
 * *Load* and *save* traces
 * Fit the histogram to a *single* or *double Gaussian* function

*An example of fiting a single Gaussian function to the cumulative histogram.*

{{{
     General model:
     fit(x) = a1*exp(-(x-b1).^2 / 2 /c1.^2 )
     Coefficients (with 95% confidence bounds):
       a1 =       79.23  (76.53, 81.93)
       b1 =       1.582  (0.8155, 2.348)
       c1 =       19.46  (18.69, 20.23)

*The results from the fitting are output to the command line.*
