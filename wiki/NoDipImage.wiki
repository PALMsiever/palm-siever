#summary What to do if you don't want to or can't install DipImage.

You can still use PALMsiever, but some of parts will not work. Specifically:

* the "Histogram + Gauss" rendering, as it uses the DipImage Gaussian filter
* the "3D Hue-Opacity" rendering, for the same reason.

To use it without error, you can comment out the two lines referring to DipImage in the {{{palmsiever_setup.m}}}.
