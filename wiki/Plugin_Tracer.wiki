#summary Documentation for Tracer v1.0

= Introduction =

Tracer allows the user to create a trace along a structure in an image. It uses the underlying molecule positions, not the rendered image.

= Walktrough =

The protocol for tracing a filamentous structure is as follows:

 1. Choose a Radius and a Step size. Radius should roughly be twice the radius of the structure. Step should be roughly twice the Radius parameter. You might need to adjust for your case

 2. Press 'Trace!'.

 3. Select a first point where to start the trace.

 4. Select a second point, roughly along the direction of the structure you want to trace. 

 5. Done! The software will trace your structure, show the trace on the screen, and save it to the workspace as 'Trace'.

= Features =

 * Generate cumulative histograms along the trace
 * Load and save traces
 * Fit the histogram to a single or double Gaussian function
