#summary Plugin for plotting Z cross sections.

= Introduction =

Plot 2D cross-sections along an arbitrary angle across XY.

= Details =

We will use the example data "FtsZ-Dendra2 C crescentus live 3D 10 ms frame.mat", and will plot a 2D Z-cross-section across the mid-cell "Z-ring", a bacterial cytokinetic structure.

Launch the plugin 'Z_cross-section' from the plugins menu:

Select a line along which to plot the cross-section, by clicking 'Select cross-section':

* To select the _axial thickness of the cross-section_, edit the 'Thickness' box

* The cross-section line can be repositioned by selecting it with the mouse, or cleared by clicking 'Clear selection'.

Click 'Cross-section view' to switch to the view of the 2D cross-section:
