#summary 3D iso-surface rendering plugin.

= Introduction =

This plugin calculates and renders 3D iso-surface volumes for 3D PALM data. The iso-surface value is automatically calculated using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method Outsu's method], and can also be manually adjusted.

= Details =

Test data: "example_data/FtsZ-Dendra2 C crescentus live 3D 10 ms frame.mat"

The plugin calculates a 3D iso-surface for the entire area displayed in the current window. Usually it is best not to do this over the whole acquired field of view, since this is very slow (and generally not very useful). In this case we are going to zoom in on one Z-ring and render it in 3D.

Load the test data, and zoom in on the indicated area:

to get something like this:

Open the 3D rendering plugin. You should see something like the following (the ring here has been rotated a little bit to show it off):
